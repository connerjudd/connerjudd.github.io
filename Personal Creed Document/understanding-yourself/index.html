                      <p>The qualities I possess that make me unique are I am teachable, I can easily learn new languages, I am a good cook. Each of these talents and gifts were developed over a lot of time experiences successes and failures. I acquired them from examples of others around me that I then made my own. </p>
                      <p>From an early age I learned that I liked to take direction from teacher’s friends and coaches. I understood that these teachings would make my life easier and improve a specific talent or skill. I remember in my freshman year of football I received the most coachable award as my coach was presenting me with this award, he said that I was able to take direction or correction and quickly implemented successfully. I did this without really knowing I was doing it when my coach gave me that award, I first saw it as a negative. Even some of my teammates called me Mama’s boy or teacher’s pet. It was not until later in life I learned and understood the value of this gift after being on teams and work environments that required me to work well with others and take direction in correction. </p>
                      <p>I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Sao Paulo Brazil. I was required to learn The Portuguese language quickly and to understand the language to a level where I was required to teach answer teach about the gospel delete answer complex questions and problem solved. I found because of my genuine love for the people I was serving I was blessed by heavenly father to quickly understand and Excel in the Portuguese language. I used this formula after my mission to also learn Spanish so I could better serve and help The Spanish speaking community around me. I learned that the Lord blesses his servants righteously seeking help to learn a new skill to benefit his Kingdom. </p>
                      <p>Lastly, I am a good cook. When I say I am a good cook I do not mean that all my meals are a revolutionary experience, I love to cook. But not for myself I love to cook for others. One of my favorite meals to cook are barbecue ribs. The process I use takes multiple hours and a lot of preparation. But nothing brings a bigger smile to my face then a group of Friends and family seated around a table enjoying the food. Good food invites good conversation and wonderful memories. And it does not hurt that the ribs taste good too. </p>
                      <p>Some of the qualities that I lack are diligence, perseverance, and finishing strong. I am actively seeking ways to improve these weaknesses. I have purchased several audio books, sought out mentors, and have been open with friends and family looking for help and improving these areas. I have learned that I need to set small achievable goals, and after time I will see improvement in these areas. </p>
                      <p>I am so grateful for these gifts that my heavenly father has given me. I know that if I put them to good use, he will bless me and help me improve beyond what I think I am capable of. </p>
