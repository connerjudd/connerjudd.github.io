                      <p><b style="font-size: 50px;">Faith:</b> I am a son of a Heavenly Father, who loves me. I have faith in His Eternal Plan. He has work for me to do.</p>
                      <p>"Faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true." (Alma 32:21)</p>
                      <p><b style="font-size: 50px;">Divine Nature:</b> I have inherited divine qualities, which I will strive to develop.</p>
                      <p>"Be partakers of the divine nature... giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. (2 Peter 1:4-7)</p>
                      <p><b style="font-size: 50px;">Individual Worth:</b> I am of infinit worth with my own divine mission, which I will strive to fulfill.</p>
                      <p>"Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God." (D&C 18:10)</p>
                      <p><b style="font-size: 50px;">Knowledge:</b> I will continually seek opportunities for learning and growth.</p>
                      <p>"Seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&C 88:118)</p>
                      <p><b style="font-size: 50px;">Choice & Accountability:</b> I will choose good over evil and will accept responsibility for my decisions.</p>
                      <p>"Choose you this day whom ye will serve; ...But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (Joshua 24:15)</p>
                      <p><b style="font-size: 50px;">Service:</b> I will help others and build the kingdom through righteous service. "With all my heart, might, mind, and strength, I will love God, keep my covenants, and use His priesthood to serve others, beginning in my own home." (Aaronic Priesthood Quorum Theme)</p>
                      <p>"Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven." (Matt 5:14-16)</p>
                      <p><b style="font-size: 50px;">Integrity:</b> I will have the moral courage to make my actions consistent with my knowledge of right and wrong.</p>
                      <p>"Till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me" (Job 27:5)</p>
                      <p><b style="font-size: 50px;">Virtue:</b> I will keep the covenants that I made in the temple and remain pure worthy.</p>
                      <p>My thoughts and actions will be based on high moral standards.</p>
                      <p>"We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paulâ€”We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." (Articles of Faith 1:13)</p>
                      <p>The Young Women Values were used and inspired these values.</p>
