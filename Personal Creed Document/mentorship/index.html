                      <p>With school I would say do not take short cuts. And ask for help from those who are set apart to help you. Do not be afraid to meet with your professors to gauge where you are at and how you can improve. Looking for help shows that you care for your education. Go above the bare minimum and show your effort and care for the topic. I would say you to set aside time regularly to look at and review your goals. You need to set a reminder to keep yourself honest. Give yourself 30min to an hour for these planning sessions.</p>
                      <p style="font-size: 50px;">Gay Andersen</p>
                      <p>In school try not to miss class and get your assignments done. Make sure you understand each professors’ expectations of you. Different teachers expect different things. This time is temporary and is a means to an end. To be successful find good mentors. Look for those you can trust who can coach and train you to be better. Do not be afraid of the hard times. It will be tough, do not worry it gets better. Give yourself some grace during your learning curve times. Make mistakes, it will help you grow.</p>
