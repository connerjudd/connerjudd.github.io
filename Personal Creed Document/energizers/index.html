                      <p><b style="font-size: 40px;">Mission</b></p>
                      <p>Being somewhat of a wayward teen, having the childhood goal of a mission was always in the back of my mind. When I graduated high school, I knew that I had to make some adjustments in my life before I would be ready to go. With the help of my parents and my stake president I made the course corrections I needed to and received the call to serve the people of Sao Paulo, Brazil. There I learned the meaning of selfless service. How to love complete strangers and work hard.</p>
                      <p><b style="font-size: 40px;">Wedding</b></p>
                      <p>Deciding my wife was the woman who I was supposed to marry was easy. I had an overwhelming feeling of peace and comfort when I prayed to know. She has been a help mate, friend, counselor, and lover. I can honestly say she knows me better than anyone on this Earth. </p>
                      <p><b style="font-size: 40px;">Academy</b></p>
                      <p>Shortly after marriage I applied to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. I was accepted into the academy. It was hard. It was a stress induced environment. There were people assigned to make sure your time there was hard and unpleasant. It was for six months. I had one of the Tac-officers pull me into his office and he told me that he was not worried that I would make it. He said that I was capable. From that moment I knew I could do anything. It was a huge boost in my confidence come graduation.</p>
                      <p><b style="font-size: 40px;">Having Kids</b></p>
                      <p>Three weeks after I graduated, I was blessed with my daughter Carly Rose Judd. She changed my life for the better. She loves me and trust me in a way no one has before. I love her and she changed my life for the better.</p>
